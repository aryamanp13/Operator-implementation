# Operator-implementation
cpp codes for different operators

## Aim:
To learn how to use operators in c++

## Theory:

Operators in C++ are special symbols that perform specific operations on one or more values.The inputs can be decided my the end user while not having to write the same thing again for another value.


1.Arithmetic Operators: Perform arithmetic operations.

I. Addition +
II. Subtraction -
III. Multiplication *
IV. Division /
V. Modulus %


2.Relational Operators: Compare values and return boolean results. 

I. Equal to ==
II. Not equal to != 
III. Less than <
IV. Greater than >
V. Less than or equal to <=
VI. Greater than or equal to >=


3.Logical Operators: Combine boolean expressions.   

I. Logical AND &&
II. Logical OR ||
III. Logical NOT !


4.Assignment Operators: Assign values to variables.

I. Simple assignment =
II. Add and assign +=
III. Subtract and assign -=
IV. Multiply and assign *=
