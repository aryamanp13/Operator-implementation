## Aim:
To learn how to use operators in c++

## Theory:
1.Arithmetic Operators: Perform arithmetic operations.   

+: Addition
-: Subtraction
*: Multiplication
/: Division
%: Modulus (remainder)

2.Relational Operators: Compare values and return boolean results.   

==: Equal to
!=: Not equal to
<: Less than

<=: Less than or equal to
>=: Greater than or equal to

3.Logical Operators: Combine boolean expressions.   

&&: Logical AND
||: Logical OR

+=: Add and assign
-=: Subtract and assign
*=: Multiply and assign
